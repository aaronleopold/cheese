A menubar application to take pictures or record videos of yourself using your webcam. I love a good menubar app ðŸ˜„

## Roadmap

I made this app to solve a very niche use-case I had, so I probably won't add any additional major functionalities. Some possible small issues/upgrades I'd like to eventually add:

- [ ] Specifying output resolution
- [ ] Allow changing file format on export screen, rather than _only_ through settings
- [ ] Allow option for voice record only?

## Future Work

There are two potential, major changes/migrations I can see choosing between for the (_very_ distant) future of this application:

- Migrate to [Vite](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder) from Webpack
  - Maintained library, less security updates/maintenence, etc.
- Mirgrate away from Electron over to [Neutralinojs](https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs)
  - Smaller bundle, less resource heavy, etc
