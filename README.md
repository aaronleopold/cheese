## Roadmap

This is more of a TODO list for me :)

- [x] Get basic UI set up
- [x] Make UI responsive
- [x] Allow selection of available devices
- [x] Allow customized storage paths
- [x] Set up application flows (e.g. home, recording, recorded/viewing, screenshot, etc)
- [ ] Allow screen shots (selfies; halfway done, I can get the image buffer currently)
  - [x] display
  - [ ] download
- [ ] Allow recording
- [ ] Fix the viewport for the camera
  - currently, restricting the size of the camera window changes the size of the resulting video. I just want the overflow to be hidden, rather than actually setting the size of the video.
- [ ] Fix the dependencies
  - This is a MESS currently. A lot of the deps just don't play well with each other and require very specific versions, which is introducing some security issues. These should be sorted out eventually.
